### Welcome to The Github Account of Robert K Teresi!

Thanks for checking out my profile. I have a few projects, professional and personal, that I am currently working on. 

On the research side I am putting together papers about:

 - Emergency Department Staffing and Optimizing Physician Teams
 - Twitter Discourse Relating to The Black Lives Matter Movement and Political Party Affiliation
 - Entrepreneurship Among Real Estate Agents

My active pure-coding projects include:
 
 - Revamping an algorithm for disambiguating Pubmed authorship
 - Creating a robust fuzzy-matching algorithm
 - Improving upon a google maps activity scraper to collect data to eventually train a model that predicts future local restaurant activity levels.
 - Deploying my personal website

If you are looking to collaborate on a project, drop me a message on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/rteresi).
